# Introduction

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup Instructions

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x

# Start
To start the notebook, run the command `jupyter notebook machine_translation.ipynb` in this directory.
Follow the instructions within the notebook.

# Models

Models used in this project with accuracy

1. Simple RNN Model: 61% <br/>
2. RNN with Embedding: 83% <br/>
3. Bidirectional RNN : 67% <br/>
4. Encoder-Decoder Model: 57% <br/>
5. **Final Model** : 97.57% <br/>

# Future Improvement
- Increase epochs for achieving higher accuracy <br/>
- Increasing more training data <br/>
- Add more layers or more units for deeper understanding of data. <br/>
